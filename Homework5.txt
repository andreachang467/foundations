1. Which of the followings is considered boxing?


c. object myobjx = fx;

2. Which of the followings is considered unboxing?

a. string str = ix.ToString();
b. double dblx =(double) fx;
d. int ix = (int) objy;

3. Object objdblx is of type double. Assign the value of this object to a variable of type float.

float fx = (float)(double) objdblx;


4. Object objflx is of type float. Assign the value of this object to another variable of type double.

double dx = (double) (float) objflx;


5. Convert the string strx to a double dblx:

double dblx = double.Parse(strx);


6.Convert the integer ix to a float fx:

float fx = (float)ix;


7. Convert the double dblx to a string strx:

string strx = dblx.ToString();



8. Object is the        BASE          class of all other data types.


9. What is an object (the definition)? it is the base class of all other types (even int. long, enum, etc).  


10. How do you declare an object in C#? you call new on the class

11. What is the difference between an object and a variable? Object type is unknown. Variable is known.
